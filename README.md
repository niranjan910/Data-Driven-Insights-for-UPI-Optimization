- 📍 City-Wise UPI Behavior  
- 🕒 Time-Based Transaction Patterns  
- 👥 User Segment Analysis (Age & Gender)  
- 🏦 Bank Performance Metrics  
- 💼 Balance vs Transaction Behavior  

Artifacts:

## 🧾 Dataset & Features

The dataset includes the following cleaned and feature-engineered columns:

- **Date**, **Time**, **Year**, **Month**, **Day**, **Weekday**, **Week**, **Hour**, **Time_Period**
- **Transaction** – UPI transaction amount (₹000s)
- **Balance** – Post-transaction balance (₹000s)
- **Age**, **Age_Groups**
- **Gender**, **City**
- **Sent_From_Bank**, **Bank_Received**
